                <p>In my third year at Luca School of Arts, I went on erasmus-trip to Lyon. There I went to ENSBA. In
                    that semester
                    I got the assignment to make a font based on the font of an old newspaper (we could chose between a
                    collection).
                    I choose 'Le Meridional'. This was my first font so it was really exciting. When
                    arriving back in Belgium I continued the assignment, so it was a really interesting trajectory. I
                    choose to present
                    the font in a newspaper with all sorts of newspaper-titles, since the font was based on a old
                    newspaper. </p>

                    In my second year at Luca School of Arts I got the assignment to make posters on a story that has a
                    book and movie version.
                    I choose 'Fahrenheit 45'. This movie talks about censorship, so I decided to play with that concept
                    in my posters.

                    In my second year at Luca School of Arts I got the assignment to make a football scarf only
                    using a
                    limited amount of material.
                    The scarf also had to be for a sport of your likings. After some research with the material we
                    could
                    use I made a scarf for the thinking sport 'Go'.
                    I liked the combination of the grid on the board and the little round things you played with. I
                    only
                    used two colors so that it would balance the already busy design on the scraf.
                    By using two colors some elements also are shown better, for example the 'gogogogo' on tha back
                    and
                    the white dots on the front.
